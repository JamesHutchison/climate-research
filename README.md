General Climate Research applying the Fractal Universe "Theory of Everything"

# Current Findings
Initial research reveals greater consistency of peak energy values over ice in Barrow, AK data, suggesting plausible
creditibility to bi-directional energy exchange creating a consistent "tunnel" or "funnel" of energy.

Current working name is "radiation pressure funnel".

It is unclear if this is a radiation equivalent to a tornado or dust devil. For now, this not speculated.

Across all sites, p99 values are more consistent and slightly diminished, suggesting either equipment upgrades were carried out
that altered characteristics of the data, or there is more energy exchange, in general, occurring across the globe.
Consistent energy exchange would reduce the ebb and flow of energy, resulting in lower peaks and higher valleys.
Net energy may increase. "Edge" energy (when the sun peaks over the Earth) seems to increase.

# Next Steps
Plausible that increase in heat and CO2 in the atmosophere may facilitate a more stable longwave energy exchange between
the Earth and the Sun. This would presumably manifest as a positive feedback loop, possibly hiding as effects exclusively
attributed to greenhouse gases. To better isolate greenhouse gas effects from incoming solar effects, CERES satellite data
may have recorded longwave data from the sun that could indicate what the overall trend is there. If the effect exists,
and it's strong enough to care, CERES may have recorded a net positive increase in longwave radiation coming from the sun
over the past couple decades.

If it has not, then it doesn't disprove this effect. The net result of a "better" energy longwave connection is not fully clear
amongst the complex climate landscape. For example, energy may get pulled in but through complex processes converted to something
else, such as magnetic energy.

The issue with terrestrial recordings is that clouds, which would increase in heat, would affect "net" effects. Additionally,
increases in heat from longwave radiation due to greenhouse gasses are expected - hence the need to isolate the two effects.
Potentially, CO2 signatured longwave radiation being radiated from Earth would help facilitate more CO2 signatured longwave
radiation from the Sun. It could also increase overall radiation. The effect is not fully understood across a complex spectrum.
